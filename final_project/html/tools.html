		<h2> Tools </h2>
		<p>
			When your playing MMO's, it is very helpful to invest in some more complex versions of common tools that you use on your PC already. The keyboard, mouse, and a headset, are all essential to making the best of your game.
		</p>
		<p class="desc"> Keyboard - When shopping for a keyboard with the intent of playing MMO's, the more keys the better. Most MMO's offer an incredibly in-depth system for creating macros and key bindings. Having more keys available means more easily accessible macro keys which will make your playing very convenient and effective. </p>
		<p class="desc"> Mouse - You can also find a mouse that offers a set of bindable buttons for even MORE accessibility. Using a mouse like this in conjunction with your keyboard will make you a PvP pro in no time. </p>
		<p class="desc"> Headset - Perhaps not quite as essential but in my opinion a good investment. Shelling out the cash for a headset with crystal clear recording and playback will make life much easier for you and your guildmates when working on taking down that boss thats bee plaguing you for weeks. </p>
