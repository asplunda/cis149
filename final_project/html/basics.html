			Throughout all MMO's there is one thing that they all will have in common that you will become a master at over time. Quests. Learning how to effectively quest in an MMO will make your leveling experience much, much easier. When questing in an MMO, always try to be as efficient as possible. When you take your first steps into a major city or outpost of NPC's ready to send you on an impressive number of seemingly irrelevant tasks, gather EVERY quest possible. Never leave anything behind because when you venture out to the unknown to complete these tasks, the worst feeling is completing all these quests, coming back to town, and realizing you missed one that wants you to go back to the exact same place you were just at. Talk about a waste of your precious time... Also, if you think that you can just ignore quests and just fight monsters to level your new character in today's MMO's, good luck.
