		<h2> Benefits and Dangers </h2>
		<p>
			Playing MMO's provide hours and hours of entertainment and really can keep you entertained constantly for a very long time. Many MMO's receive regular updates and expansions to always provide new things for its players to do. If you are heavily invested in one game, then spending on other games may drop significantly which might lead to saving a bit of money!

			Unfortunately there is a downside to all this entertainment. MMO's are incredibly addictive in their nature and can lead to many problems in the real world. I personally have seen a few cases of people losing jobs and friends  because of addiction to an MMO. This is however very avoidable. Just remember that there is a real world out there and its a good idea to give it your attention every once and awhile!
