			One of the biggest things that make MMO's so appealing is the social aspect. Being polite and friendly with your fellow players will help you go far in your adventures. After all my years playing MMO's, it still amazes me the connection that people can make in a video game. Finding a guild makes even the most mediocre of MMO's seem like the greatest gaming experience in the history of mankind. Which brings me to my next point. Guilds. Most MMO's have great guild systems and the earlier you find a guild and start making friends, the earlier you will fall in love with the game.

			One important thing that seems to be forgotten by a lot of people in the MMO community, is that those other players are real people. Treating them as such will earn you a lot of respect and build strong friendships inside the game and sometimes those friendships translate to the real world. So like your parents always told you, treat others the way you would like to be treated.
