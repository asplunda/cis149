		<h1> History </h1>
		<h2> Progress </h2>
		<p>
			The success of the big three led to a boom in MMO development in the early 2000's. Everquest found a serious competitor in Dark Age of Camelot. In 2002 MapleStory released and was the first MMO to introduce a completely free-to-play model, making all of it's profits through an in-game shop allowing players to purchase enhancements for their characters and cosmetic items.

			In 2004 Everquest attempted to move to a new generation of MMO's with better graphics and gameplay with the release of Everquest 2. Judging by the success of Everquest, they expected Everquest 2 to be a major success, but another game released the same year and took the market by storm. Blizzard released their new MMO, World of Warcraft. To this day, World of Warcraft stands as the only MMO still running a successful subscription model.
